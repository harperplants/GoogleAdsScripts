Hi,
Thanks for reaching out. Your script report looks good, but the totalNumEntities method is currently not available in the ReportRowIterator. 

As a workaround, I would suggest to create a counter variable to be incremented in your loop to sum up the number of rows retrieved in your report.
 
However, you can change your approach by using the AdGroupSelector and AdGroupIterator to retrieve all of the negative keywords in each ad group. 
After that, you should be able to use the totalNumEntities that is available in the NegativeKeywordIterator. 
You may check out the example in this link on how to get negative keywords in an ad group. 
All that's left to do is to add in your code to export these data in a spreadsheet.
